# Sepia-ASM-project
Project created during Assembly Languages course on my studies at Silesian University of Technology.

Project implements sepia filter algorithm in two ways: in C++ and in ASM using vector instructions.
The project core is implemented in C# and uses 2 DLLs. After launching, we can load .bmp file, chose threads number 1-64
(when program starts it automatically detects our processor threads number and sets it), chose DLL, run it, measure execution time
and save new .bmp file.
